// Async
/* 
    -Introduced in ES@)!&
    -Async Functions can be thought of as a alternate way of writing promise-based code.
    -Avoid Chaining promises.
    -Allows us to program using asynchronous requests, (API requests), in a "synchronous" manner.
        -Synchronous code is executed in sequence. Each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing.

    -Helps keep our site or app responsive, reducing waiting time for he user.
